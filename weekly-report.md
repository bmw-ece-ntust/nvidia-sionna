## 2024-06-20
1. Successfully installed [Sionna-RT on Windows PC](./docs/Installation%20Guide.md##2-sionna-installation-via-pip):
   1. Managed to install version 0.15.0, which is compatible with the current Windows version.
   2. Noted that the latest version available from Nvidia for Ubuntu is 0.18.0.
2. Conducted a test on the [Hello_world.ipynb](./Hello_World.ipynb) template, sourced from the [NVIDIA template](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/examples/Hello_World.html).
    > [!NOTE]
    > The Hello World test failed at the second step due to incompatibility issues with version 0.15.0.
    > 
    > **Proposed Solution**: Install Sionna on an Ubuntu machine and retest using version 0.18.0.
